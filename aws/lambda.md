# AWS Lambda
It is a serverless computing service by AWS 
Allow developers to run code without managing or provisioning servers. 

## How Lambda Works
Lambda does not bypass the Operating system. 
It is built on top of a Linux OS.
You dont get access to the OS 
AWS manages the OS for you. 
This is a form of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). 

## What is servereless

The AWS Lambda service handles all the low-level details:
 Provisioning the server.
 Installing and patching the OS.
 Setting up the language runtime (Python 3.12).
 Scaling up or down to handle requests.

"serverless" â€” not because there are no servers, 
but because you don't have to manage them. 
The OS is there, but it is part of the managed infrastructure that you are renting from AWS for just a few milliseconds or seconds at a time.
